# Jason and the Golden Fleece Game
This project is a prototype game that I have been developing for my PhD thesis project.  I am researching new ways to arrange stories that could be used with open-world adventure and RPG games.

You can read more about the storytelling framework and the game here: http://gailcarmichael.com/research/projects/emergentstories
